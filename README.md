### Steps to Run JUnit Tests Locally

1. **Open the Project:** Start IntelliJ IDEA and open your project.

2. **Run Tests:**
   - **Single Test Method:** Right-click on the method name > `Run '<method_name>'`.
   - **All Tests in a Class:** Right-click on the class file > `Run 'Tests in <class_name>'`.

### Running Tests on LambdaTest

To execute tests on LambdaTest, populate the following environment variables in your IntelliJ IDEA run configurations:

- `LT_USERNAME` with your LambdaTest username.
- `LT_ACCESS_KEY` with your LambdaTest access key.

### Editing Run Configurations

1. **Access Run Configurations:** `Run` > `Edit Configurations...`
2. **Set Environment Variables:** Select your test > `Configuration` tab > `Environment variables`.
   - Input `LT_USERNAME=<your_username>;LT_ACCESS_KEY=<your_access_key>`.

### Viewing Test Results

Results are displayed in the Run window, detailing passed and failed tests, execution time, and exceptions.
